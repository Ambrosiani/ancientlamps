This type differs from Atlante type X only by the flukes on each side of the channeled nozzle, perhaps a reminiscence of volutes. The type has two variants: in XI A (cat. 503) the open discus is connected to the wick-hole area by a channel, while in XI B (cat. 504) the discus is closed and surrounded by a continuous shoulder-frame. The rarity of the discus decor of cat. 504 is worth pointing out. A central Tunisian place of manufacture or origin can be assumed for both lamps. Date: Second half of fifth century A.D.
