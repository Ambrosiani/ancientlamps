Little is known about these curious lighting devices in the shape of a jug. Most of the few published ones come from Egypt, as is the case with cat. 510. The BM donor of lamp Q 532, excavated at <a href='../../map/#loc_727093'>Tell el-Fara’in</a> (ancient Bouto), Egypt, specified that this type of lamp is “very common in and around Alexandria” (<a href='../../bibliography/#bailey-bm-i'>Bailey BM I</a>, p. 250). Bailey wonders if these juglike vessels might not simply be fillers for pouring liquid, but adds that at least Q 530 has been used as a lamp, for there are burn marks around the spout. The substantial burn marks all around the wick-hole on cat. 510 confirm that those vessels could be used as lamps.
