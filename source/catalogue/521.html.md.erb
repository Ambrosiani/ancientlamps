We have not found any parallel to the peculiar shape of cat. 521. With its hexagonal discus it has some resemblance to cat. <%= link_to "520", "../catalogue/520.html" %>, but it differs from it by its ribbed body and undulating side, justifying an individual presentation. The color of its clay and slip, the depth of its basin, and the raised rim around the wick-hole attest to an eastern place of manufacture or origin of this lamp, which was purchased in Anatolia. The relation to cat. <%= link_to "520", "../catalogue/520.html" %>, and thus to Bailey type I, suggests a date at the end of the first century A.D., but its solid handle may equally well indicate a later date.
