The production of this type is limited to {{loc_7000623:Tripolitania}}, but the products were exported to a relatively wide area: Tunisia, Italy, Sicily, Spain, and Malta. A few examples are known in Greece, Egypt, and Turkey. (See refs. given in *Atlante* I, pp. 204â€“5.) The study of the type presented in *Atlante* distinguishes three forms: in form XIII the discus is delimited by a circular ridge; in XV the ridge around the discus prolongs itself in a channel that enables the open discus to communicate with the wick-hole; form XIV is a combination of XIII and XV. The clay and slip are usually red or near brown. The wide shoulder is always flat and decorated with vegetal or geometrical motifs, the latter usually being raised circles decorated with one or several beads in a row. The vertical handle is solid and slightly inclined backward. Date: fourth to fifth century A.D.
