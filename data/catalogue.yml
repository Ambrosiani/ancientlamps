  Description: |
    Wheelmade.[^1] Deep body broadening toward bottom; two grooves surround the lower part of the basin. Rounded circular rim sloping down to a large filling-hole. Squat short tubular and upturned nozzle with a rounded tip and flat-topped plate—a characteristic feature of some Hellenistic lamps that can occur also on Anatolian lamps of the third to fourth century A.D. Broad circular flat base.

    [^1]: We classify this lamp in our section ii B 3, Hellenistic lamps of undetermined types, despite the fact that contrary to the others it seems to be wheelmade and not moldmade.

  Discussion: |
    The scene on the discus may be interpreted as a game, or as a skill exercise consisting of introducing as many balls as possible into the spiral groove before the horse’s forelegs touch the ground again.

    An ornament handle of a two-nozzled lamp found in {{loc_599612:Ephesus}} shows a similar decor. The structure on the post has been interpreted by Zahn as a sundial, and the gesture of the rider’s right hand is supposed to indicate the time (Heres 1972, p. 36, quoting Zahn). Such a reading does not account for the two small balls between the man’s thumb and forefinger.

  Discussion: |
    Bailey assigns the end of production of his type B = Loeschcke type iv to the Trajanic period (BM ii, p. 157). Logically, there would be a chronological incompatibility with a lamp of this type showing Hadrian’s portrait. But later, Bailey admits that the production of Cnidian lamps of his type B lasted until the beginning of Hadrian’s reign, as proved by several lamps of this type bearing that emperor's portrait (Bailey BM iii, p. 327).

    Following the earlier chronology of the type given in BM ii, Mlasowsky is the only author to assume that the portrait is Domitian’s. However, the portraits of Domitian we have consulted—on sculptures and coins, in addition to the examples given by Mlasowsky (2003, figs. 4–6)—do not show the emperor with a beard, in contrast to the portraits of Hadrian. It is surprising that Mlasowsky does not mention any parallels to the Hanover lamp he publishes, nor does he refer to the commonly accepted interpretation of the portrait as Hadrian (Mlasowsky 2003, p. 184, figs. 1–3).

    About a similar lamp in the BM, Bailey writes:

    **EX** The wounded Philoctetes reclines in a cave, supporting his head on his left hand; he is draped about the lower body and legs, and wears sandals. In his right hand he holds, as a fly-whisk, the wing of a bird. In front of the cave is a dead bird and a leaf. Ulysses, wearing a pointed cap, peers round the left side of the cave mouth, while above the mouth of the cave Neoptolemus is shown reaching down to remove the bow and quiverful of arrows which had belonged to Hercules, but was at that time in the possession of Philoctetes. Neoptolemus, who holds on to the edge of the cave with his left hand, has two very curious “wings” rising from his shoulders; he is, perhaps, conflated here with Cupid, who was given to playing with Hercules’ weapons (BM ii, p. 35, Q 1069, fig. 32).

  Discussion: "The bearded head in the discus is sometimes interpreted as Hercules because of what seems to be a club on his right shoulder, at other times as a portrait of Hadrian or Antoninus Pius, which seems more likely (Bailey BM ii, Q 1311). However, the interpretation of either emperor’s portrait fails to match the chronology of the workshop {{insc:oppi}} (active A.D. 70/80–100), who signs a lamp bearing this particular decor: see Brentchaloff 1972, no. 80 (see discussion in Bussière 2000, p. 172, decor i.d.2). If the portrait is read as that of an emperor, then {{insc:oppi}}’s chronology must be revised, and Hadrian must be preferred to Antoninus Pius (see discussion in Gualandi Genito 1986, p. 208, no. 60; or in Bussière 2000, p. 172, decor i.d.1.[2])."

  Discussion: "According to Bailey, each lar is pouring liquid from a rhyton into a situla, the groove representing the stream of liquid (see Bailey BM ii, p. 235, Q 1095). This conventional representation of a stream is not visible on the parallels listed above, which are mostly slightly blurred. On this lamp the curved lines link the rhyta to the altar, not to the situlae. It may be a misrepresentation of an earlier model as seen in Bailey’s BM ii, Q 1095."

  Discussion: |
    A workshop signature ({{insc:exoficina c.v.s.}}) inscribed on top of the discus is very unusual on first- or second-century Roman lamps, but it occurs occasionally on African lamps of the third century and later. Since the workshop name already figures on the discus of the lamp, could the inscription on the base be the name of the potter himself and not that of the workshop? It is exceptional that two different names are inscribed, one on the discus (the workshop), the other (the potter[?]) on the base. Among the thousands of African lamps Bussière has studied, he has never seen a similar case.

    The rays on the underside of the nozzle are a common decor on third-century African lamps.

  Description: |
    Moldmade. Intact; top partially overpainted. Ring handle with three grooves on upper part. Flat shoulder, separated from discus by a flat raised band marked off by two grooves and interrupted by a short channel between discus and nozzle; rectangular panel on each side of shoulder; crude vine and bunch of grapes on upper shoulder between panels and handle; incised circle on each side of handle, one close to left bunch of grapes; incised circle on each side of nozzle channel; another on the left shoulder close to nozzle. Discus masks are joined by an asymmetrical flat ridge marked off by a circular groove. Central filling-hole. Small air hole in lower field. Heart-shaped nozzle encroaching upon shoulder, close to Bus. 4.3[^2]. Base-ring marked off by two deep circular grooves; incuse plain *planta pedis* in center.

    [^2]: Despite its heart-shaped nozzle, this lamp is not placed with other lamps with similar nozzles, but rather, here, close to lamps it resembles in terms of its discus decor, its shape, and the presence of the two rectangular panels on the shoulders, which belong to Broneer type xxvii.

  Discussion: |
    The structure represented in the discus has different levels marked off by two (three[?]) horizontal lines, possibly representing what might be referred to as “shelves”; on top “shelf” are two more or less vertical, rectangular shapes with rounded top, one in the middle, the other at left; on them are seven or eight raised globules arranged within diagonal lines. The interpretation of the shape on the right is uncertain. On the middle “shelf” is a series of five square panels with an X-shaped cross on each. On both “shelves” one can see also a series of small objects, either round or semicircular, three on the lower “shelf,” five on the upper one. One Cupid, standing on a ladder at left, is just placing the fifth one. Another Cupid, seated at right on a high stool, has in his left hand a puzzling curved object containing a well-defined globular form. Two more Cupids, standing in the foreground, are busy passing an object between them.

    The scene is so far unexplained, but the interpretation of the two rows of small objects on the shelves might give a possible clue, as well as the activity of the Cupid sitting at right. It would also be interesting to explain the shape under his left foot and the vertical grooves behind. Unfortunately the quality of the copy of this unusual decor is mediocre, and several parts are blurred, for instance, the central part above the filling-hole, where one supposes a third “shelf,” a portion just above the sitting Cupid, and one behind the Cupid standing at left in the foreground.

  Discussion: |
    Bernhard interprets the three buildings in the upper register of the discus as the Mausoleum of Alexander, the Temple of Alexander, and the tomb of Cleopatra, all in Alexandria (Bernhard 1955; Bernhard 1956). This opinion is shared by Amaré Tafalla and Liz Guiral 1994, p. 35; and by Rostovtzeff 1911, p. 153, fig. 66. For his part, Bailey claims that since most of the harbor-scene lamps of Deneauve type x have been found in Tunisia, several bearing well-known African potters’ signatures, the harbor must be Carthage rather than Alexandria or Ostia (Bailey 1984, pp. 271–72).

  Description: "Moldmade. Ornament handle in the shape of a horse’s head with curved neck, pierced at base; at midheight of neck a thick ridge not completely surrounding it. Narrow outward-sloping shoulder, separated from discus by a band of radiating pattern: two parallel short straight lines surmounted by a heart-shaped motif alternating with a short straight line with globular top. Central filling-hole. Air hole in lower field. Large angular-tipped volute-nozzle; thinly striated double-volutes with curling spines incised on flat nozzle top; on the underside, a heart-shaped motif marked off by two thin grooves. Raised rounded base-ring marked off by two circular grooves; additional inner flat ring marked off the same way."

For the ornament handle, see Rodríguez Martín 2002 (Merida museum), fig. 1.1, and fig. 19.7; the lamp in fig. 1.1, inv. no. 938, p. 44, pl. 5.1, is classified by Rodríguez Martín as a variant of Bailey type D group iii = Deneauve v B, despite the fact that its nozzle is more triangular than ogival and not far from the nozzle of this lamp. The ornament handle of the {{loc_0000:Merida}} lamp has a striking resemblance to the handle of this lamp. We wonder if the Merida lamp should not rather be considered a variant of Deneauve type x B, although it is true that Augustan lamps of Bailey type D i or D iii, sometimes have handles in the shape of a horse’s head, imitating bronze models. Making the same mistake, Ponsich wrongly attributed his lamp no. 33, pl. 5, to Loeschcke type i, when it belongs to Deneauve type x A, dated to Severan times (Ponsich 1961)."

  Discussion: |
    The inscription is well and occurs in several variations. The Getty version is incomplete, partly contracted, and missing four letters due to a smudge. Two distinct types of lamps carry the essence of this inscription:

    a. The Getty lamp and an identical one in Rosenthal and Sivan 1978, p. 142, no. 580, where, however, no letters are smudged; and Loffreda 1989, pp. 124–25, no. 661; the same lamp is discussed in Loffreda 1990, p. 487, fig. 5.23: peculiar orthography identical to this lamp, including iota instead of ypsilon ({{insc:ΕΥΛΟΓΙΑ}}), a single ypsilon replacing iota/ypsilon (end of {{insc:ΘΕΟΤΟΚY}}), same contraction (for {{insc:MEΘHMΩΝ}}); however, cat. 548 has a full theta ({{insc:ΘΕΟΤΟΚY}}), not replaced by an omicron, as in Loffreda.

    b. A flatter lamp type with two concentric rows of letters, leaving enough space for the full inscription. There are many examples of this version, for instance, Kennedy 1963, no. 818, pl. 30; Bagatti 1964, pp. 266–68, nos. 11 and 12 (the inscription moves in opposite directions on the two lamps); Zouhdi 1974, no. 7; Rosenthal and Sivan 1978, p. 142, no. 581; Israeli and Avida 1988, p. 172, no. 488; Loffreda 1989, p. 125, no. 437; Loffreda 1990, pp. 487–88, fig. 5.24; Hübinger 1993, p. 127, no. 243, pl. 30 (most of these with further refs.); Djuric 1995, p. 80, no. C 247: the text in the outer circle partly perforated by six additional wick-holes; C 248 carries a partially different inscription; Bussière and Rivel 2012, no. 346.

    The full version of the Greek reads in translation: “Blessing of the Mother of God be with us,” followed by “Inscription of John” (whose identity remains unknown, Kennedy 1963, p. 94; less likely the potter, as suggested by Bagatti 1964, p. 268, and by Loffreda 1989, p. 125). The peculiar shape of the rarer lamp (type a), represented by the Getty example and its parallels, necessitated a compressed formula. A clear epigraphic analysis of both versions is found in Loffreda 1989, pp. 124–25, and Loffreda 1990, pp. 487–88. All the lamps derive from the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Palestine and Syria; the suggested date varies from fifth to eighth century; we have adopted the later period, proposed by the majority of authors: seventh to eighth century A.D.
