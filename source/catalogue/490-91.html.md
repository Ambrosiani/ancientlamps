Lamps of this type are characterized by their convex shoulders decorated with relief foliage scrolls. The type originated in central Tunisia, mainly in the workshop located at <a href='../../map/#loc_324738'>Henchir es-Srira</a>, where plaster molds with shoulder-scroll decor have been found in numbers (Peacock, Bejaoui, and Ben Lazreg 1990, figs. 12e and 12m). According to Bonifay, lamps with a pierced handle are earlier (<a href='../../bibliography/#bonifay-2004a'>Bonifay 2004a</a>, p. 358). At <a href='../../map/#loc_315093'>Nabeul</a> they appear in contexts dated to the second half or the end of the fourth century A.D. Later examples with a solid handle appear in layers dated to the first half of the fifth century A.D.
