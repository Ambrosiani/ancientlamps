This is the most abundant type in {{loc_0000:Raqqada}}, represented by forty-three examples, which Ennabli arranges into seven distinct series. The main characteristic of the type is a raised ridge surrounding both the discus and the nozzle top, leaving a broad channel connecting the discus to the wick-hole area. The shoulder and base forms are similar to those of Raqqada type 14. The lamps date to the second half of third century A.D.
