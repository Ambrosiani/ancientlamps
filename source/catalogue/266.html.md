Deneauve type IV E derives from an older Hellenistic type, Deneauve type XIII, produced in <a href='../../map/#loc_314921'>Carthage</a>, which already frequently bears the Tanit sign, as type IV E does. As a survival of its Hellenistic antecedent, type IV E maintains a cylindrical body, large circular discus marked off by one groove, left side-lug, and sometimes two small holes near the lower part of the discus (cf. Deneauve 1969, lamp no. 374, pl. 43, to lamp no. 230, pl. 31). But the tip of the nozzle, no longer rounded or anvil-shaped, is splayed and has an obtuse angle as on Loeschcke type I lamps. The nozzle top of cat. 266 is plain except for the Tanit sign. On several lamps of this type one can see the preliminary suggestion of volutes in a slight relief marked off by curved grooves (Deneauve 1969, nos. 374–402, pls. 43–44). This feature appears also on lamps of type Dressel/Ricci 3 A, whose production began at about the same time as Deneauve type IV E (see as an example [cat. 73](73)). It announces the volute-nozzle of Loeschcke type I soon to come. Another feature shared by the two types is the pronounced relief of the discus decor (see Pavolini 1990, p. 106, fig. 2.8, or no. 272, pl. 34).

According to Deneauve, the type appeared ca. 50/40 B.C. and did not last long. Its production seems to have been limited exclusively to Carthage.
