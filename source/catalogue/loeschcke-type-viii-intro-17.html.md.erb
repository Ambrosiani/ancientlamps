This group consists of Bussière D X 10 lamps of Loeschcke type VIII with various unusual shoulder decors, occurring either once or in very limited numbers. The shoulder of <%= link_to "cat. 396", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> has vine tendrils, <%= link_to "cat. 397", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> connected spirals, <%= link_to "cat. 398", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> features garlands, <%= link_to "cat. 399", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> two rows of dots, <%= link_to "cat. 400", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> a molding, <%= link_to "cat. 401", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> angular lines forming a row of plain triangles, <%= link_to "cat. 433", "catalogue/433-34.html" %> small heart-shaped motifs, and <%= link_to "cat. 434", "catalogue/433-34.html" %> rows of ornated triangles.

The nozzle shapes vary but most lamps have nozzle form Bus. 10b. The nozzle underside of <%= link_to "cat. 398", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> is decorated with the already-mentioned motif consisting of a dotted band (see <%= link_to "Introduction 14", "catalogue/loeschcke-type-viii-intro-14.html" %>).

The discus decors of cats. <%= link_to "396", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> and <%= link_to "398–99", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> are related to mythology, <%= link_to "cat. 400", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> shows a quadriga, <%= link_to "cat. 401", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> hares, <%= link_to "cat. 433", "catalogue/433-34.html" %>  a rosette, <%= link_to "cat. 434", "catalogue/433-34.html" %>  a centaur, and <%= link_to "cat. 397", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> is plain.

Five lamps have a base-ring marked off by two circular grooves, two have a plain base-ring, one is a base marked off by one circular groove. There are three workshop marks: <%= link_to "cat. 397", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> a plain *planta pedis,* <%= link_to "cat. 400", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> possibly <span class="inscription">MISASIVS</span> or <span class="inscription">ANSASIVS</span>(?), <%= link_to "cat. 401", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> <span class="inscription">Q V I N T V S I V S P I C T O R E T C E N E N S</span>.

The lamps grouped under D X 10 may have various shapes and do not form a coherent series. Therefore, they can be dated only individually, and due to that lack of dated comparanda, the chronology below is very approximate. <%= link_to "Cat. 433", "catalogue/433-34.html" %> may be assigned to the end of Flavian to the Antonine period, <%= link_to "cat. 397", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> to the second century A.D., cats. <%= link_to "396", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> and <%= link_to "398", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> to a period from the end of the second to the beginning of the third century, <%= link_to "cat. 401", "catalogue/396-401.html" %> to the end of the third century A.D.
