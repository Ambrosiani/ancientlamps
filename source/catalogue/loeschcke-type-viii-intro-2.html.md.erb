Because of their nozzle form Bus. 2a, the absence of a handle, and the ovolo decoration of the shoulder, <%= link_to "cats. 324–25", "catalogue/324-25.html" %> are classified as Bussière form D I 2, even though <%= link_to "cat. 325", "catalogue/324-25.html" %> has a flat shoulder and not the Loeschcke shoulder form VI b that <%= link_to "cat. 324", "catalogue/324-25.html" %> has.
