This form is a variant of Deneauve type V, itself corresponding to Loeschcke type V. This variant seems to be rare: it is absent in the typology of <a href='../../bibliography/#bisi-ingrassia-1977'>Bisi Ingrassia 1977</a> (lamps from <a href='../../map/#loc_432873'>Herculaneum</a>), as well as in Pavolini’s typology of 1977 (lamps in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples). Apart from Deneauve’s lamp no. 637 (<a href='../../bibliography/#deneauve-1969'>Deneauve 1969</a>, pl. 14), we do not know any parallel to cat. 267. The two close parallels referred to by Deneauve (<a href='../../bibliography/#perlzweig-1961'>Perlzweig 1961</a>, no. 80; and <a href='../../bibliography/#menzel-1969'>Menzel 1969</a>, no. 244, fig. 20) both have a handle; moreover they do not have a V-shaped channel in front of the nozzle. This channel and the absence of a handle, which are characteristics of an early date in Loeschcke type I A, suggest for this variant a date at the very beginning of the Loeschcke type V production, ca. mid-first century A.D.
