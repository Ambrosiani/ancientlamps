The characteristic of this type is the prolongation of the discus rim down the nozzle to the tip, which it surrounds, making a broad open channel between the discus and the wick-hole area. Buchi distinguishes three variants in this type, a, b, and c.

Cats. 449 and 450 have no handle. The base of cat. 449 has two unequal-sized rings like the ones seen on the bases of type IX; the base of cat. 450 has three rings. Both lamps have a workshop signature in relief capital letters, upside-down: <span class="inscription">OCTAVI</span> (cat. 449) and <span class="inscription">CAMPILI</span> (cat. 450). These two workshops were active in northern Italy from Flavian times until the beginning of the second century A.D. But local workshops produced lamps bearing their names until the beginning of the third century, if not later (<a href='../../bibliography/#buchi-1975'>Buchi 1975</a>, pp. 16–17 and 127–28).
