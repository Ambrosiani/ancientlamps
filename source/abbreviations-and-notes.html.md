An “ovo pattern” is a motif often found on the base of African second-century-a.d. lamps. It consists of two small circles linked by a V-shaped design. None of these parts is a letter. This motif is repeated three times evenly displayed between two circular lines. For slight variations, see <a href='../bibliography/#bussiere-2000'>Bussière 2000</a> (p. 235, nos. 76–78). The pattern may be specific to some workshops.
