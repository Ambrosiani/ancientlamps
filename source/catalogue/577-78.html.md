Twenty-seven fragments donated by Dr. Max Gerchik have been inventoried in two series. The fragments were part of a large group of nearly seven thousand pottery sherds representing Etruscan bucchero, Etruscan and Faliscan black-glaze and red-figure, Hellenistic red-glaze, and Italic black-glaze, as well as coarseware vessels dating from the fourth to the first century B.C. All fragments belong to moldmade lamps of the same type: Howland 49 A = Bruneau VII.
