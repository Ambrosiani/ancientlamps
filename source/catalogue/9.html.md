A lamp in the British Museum is almost identical to cat. 9: same inward-sloping side profile, humped nozzle top, and raised base. Bailey dates this unglazed lamp, which seems to be a local production in {{loc_599636:Halicarnassus}}, from about 350 to about 330 B.C. (Bailey BM I, p. 116, Q 208, pl. 40, from Halicarnassus). Another interesting parallel from {{loc_648789:Tarsus}} is given by Goldman with a later dating: second to early first century B.C. (Goldman et al. 1950, group VIII, nos. 101â€“16, Tarsus).
