No parallel has so far been found for the peculiar shape of cat. 518. The color of its clay and slip and the depth of its basin attest to its eastern place of manufacture or origin; it was purchased in Anatolia. The sunken circular cavity impressed in the center of the base is unusual; Bailey reports such a mark, but much smaller, on Ephesian lamps and on a Late Asia Minor type (<a href='../../bibliography/#bailey-bm-iii>Bailey BM III</a>, p. 371). Lacking comparanda, the proposed date of the second half of the first or the second century A.D. is based on the handle and the nozzle shape only.
