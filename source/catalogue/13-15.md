Lamps of this type are characterized by a sharply biconical body with a substantial concave top area, defined by a raised rim set off by a groove, which surrounds the filling-hole. These lamps have a rather long, flat-topped nozzle with a rounded or blunt end and a raised, slightly concave base. Generally without a handle, they often have a pierced lug (Howland 1958, pp. 99â€“100). A pinkish-buff clay with a glaze, at times flaked, is often applied inside and out, including on the base; the glaze varies in color from black or dark brown to red. Found in {{loc_590031:Rhodes}}, Cyprus, {{loc_599588:Delos}}, the Athenian Agora, {{loc_609307:Antioch}}, and Palestine, the lamps are dated to the first half of the third century B.C. Cat. 15 keeps the basic features of cats. 13 and 14, but due to its longer blunt-tipped nozzle, it may be considered a variant of Howland type 32.
