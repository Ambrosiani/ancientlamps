We have not found any parallel to cat. 501, the variant with one nozzle. The herringbone decor on its shoulder relates it to Hayes type I. The variant with two nozzles, cat. 502, corresponds to Bonifay type 75. Not much is known about it. For similar but larger lamps corresponding to Bonifay type 78, see <a href='../../bibliography/#ennabli-1976'>Ennabli 1976</a>, nos. 537, 743, 867, 997, and 1192. For the workshop mark in the shape of a palm branch, see <a href='../../bibliography/#bussiere-2007'>Bussière 2007</a>, p. 80, on lamps of Hayes type I. The date given for cat. 502—end of fifth to beginning of sixth century A.D.(?)—is borrowed from <a href='../../bibliography/#bonifay-2004a'>Bonifay 2004a</a>).
