This group of fifteen lamps is very homogenous. All have Loeschcke shoulder form VII b. Out of the fifteen discus decors, six are related to the circus and amphitheater, five to animals, and four to mythology. All lamps have a flat base marked off by one groove only. Eleven examples have a workshop signature, either a single name, or *tria nomina.* The period of activity of several well-known workshops—{{insc:LMADIEC, LMVNSVC, EROTIS, GABMERC}}, and {{insc:LMSV}}—is Late Flavian to Trajanic, possibly Hadrianic. On this basis we will not refer to the broader and too approximate dating given by Bailey to his group iv: Claudian to Trajanic. A Claudian beginning for the production of this group seems much too early and not in accordance with the periods of activity for the workshops.
