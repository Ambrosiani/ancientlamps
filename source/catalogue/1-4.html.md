The first clay lamps ever devised and produced in numbers appeared in the Near East in the late third millennium (<a href='../../bibliography/#amiran-1969'>Amiran 1969</a>, pp. 189–90, pl. 59, pp. 291–93, pl. 100). They were handmade and had the shape of a square shallow bowl with four pinched corners, making four wick-rests (<a href='../../bibliography/#rosenthal-sivan-1978'>Rosenthal and Sivan 1978</a>, p. 76, no. 311). A second form, now wheelmade and soon prevailing, took the shape of a saucer with one pinched corner forming a single wick-rest or spout (<a href='../../bibliography/#rosenthal-sivan-1978'>Rosenthal and Sivan 1978</a>, p. 76, nos. 312–21). This shape—see cats. 1 and 2—lasted for about two thousand years with little change. Then a second pinched spout (sometimes more) was added (<a href='../../bibliography/#oziol-1977'>Oziol 1977</a>, nos. 33–37, pl. 3). In a later stage of evolution the lamp changed from a saucer to more of a plain bowl with a flat and slightly raised base and two sides folded together, meeting on top to form a single wick-hole (<a href='../../bibliography/#rosenthal-sivan-1978'>Rosenthal and Sivan 1978</a>, p. 79, nos. 329–30).

In the Punic area, not long before the fall of <a href='../../map/#loc_314921'>Carthage</a> (146 B.C.), this last shape was further modified: Three sides of the bowl were pinched together to form two tubular nozzles, or wick-holes, at the front and a broad opening at the rear (<a href='../../bibliography/#rosenthal-sivan-1978'>Rosenthal and Sivan 1978</a>, p. 67, nos. 274–75). Finally, the lamp was equipped with a raised circular base, making a small foot, and it became a closed vessel with three evenly spaced equal-sized openings for the wick-holes; for this shape, see cats. 3 and 4, which are similar to <a href='../../bibliography/#rosenthal-sivan-1978'>Rosenthal and Sivan 1978</a>, p. 67, nos. 276–77. By the end of the second century B.C. the long life of the saucer type came to an end.
