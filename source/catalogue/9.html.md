A lamp in the British Museum is almost identical to cat. 9: same inward-sloping side profile, humped nozzle top, and raised base. Bailey dates this unglazed lamp, which seems to be a local production in <a href='../../map/#loc_599636'>Halicarnassus</a>, from about 350 to about 330 B.C. (<a href='../../bibliography/#bailey-bm-i'>Bailey BM I</a>, p. 116, Q 208, pl. 40, from Halicarnassus). Another interesting parallel from <a href='../../map/#loc_648789'>Tarsus</a> is given by Goldman with a later dating: second to early first century B.C. (<a href='../../bibliography/#goldman-et-al-1950'>Goldman et al. 1950</a>, group VIII, nos. 101â€“16, Tarsus).
