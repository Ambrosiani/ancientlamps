No parallel has been found to this peculiar shape of lamp. The color of its clay and slip, the depth of its basin, and the small impressed circles on shoulder and base all attest to an eastern Mediterranean place of manufacture or origin of this lamp, which was purchased in Anatolia (see introduction [14. Loeschcke type VIII. a. General remarks](14.-Loeschcke-type-viii.-a.-General-remarks)). The date proposed for the lamp is based on its handle and nozzle shape: first to second century A.D.(?).
