Lamps of this type are scarce and characterized by their deep body, deeply sunken flat-bottomed discus, steeply sloping walls, and broad-based single nozzle. It appears four times only in BM II. Bailey states having found only one published parallel. Since then two lamp catalogues have recorded one example each: Goethert-Polaschek 1985, no. 695, pl. 74; and Fitch and Goldman 1994, p. 184, no. 984, fig. 102. There are no examples in Deneauve 1969 or Bussi√®re 2000. The date, according to Bailey, is the last years of the first century B.C. and the first third of the first century A.D.
