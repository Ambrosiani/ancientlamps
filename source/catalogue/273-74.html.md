Lamps of this type are characterized by an oval shape. The few examples recorded all have a ring handle and a shoulder Loeschcke form IV a. The nozzle is reduced to a wick-hole placed at the lower extremity of the oval body. The common discus decor is a scallop shell, as on cat. 274; however, a few are related to mythology: Victory (<a href='../../bibliography/#bemont-chew-2007'>Bémont and Chew 2007</a>, p. 446, pl. 21, IT 47), Venus lying on a shell (<a href='../../bibliography/#deneauve-1969'>Deneauve 1969</a>, no. 295), or Cupid (cat. 273). The flat oval base is in some cases marked off by two grooves. The type was developed in Italy, but a local production is attested in <a href='../../map/#loc_167717'>Lugdunum</a> (Lyon), where four identical examples were produced by the La Butte workshop (<a href='../../bibliography/#elaigne-1993'>Elaigne 1993</a>, p. 243; <a href='../../bibliography/#hanotte-2005'>Hanotte 2005</a>, p. 153); a fifth example, likewise found in Lyon, may come from the same workshop (<a href='../../bibliography/#bemont-chew-2007'>Bémont and Chew 2007</a>, p. 271, no. GA 178, pl. 51). The known examples of the type belong to two groups according to size: a bigger one with an average length of 12–13 cm and a smaller one, 6–8 cm. The Lyon local production (La Butte) belongs to the second group. The type is dated to the second half of first century A.D.
