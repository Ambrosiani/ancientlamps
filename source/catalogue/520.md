No parallel to the peculiar shape of cat. 520 has so far been found. Despite the fact that its body is hexagonal, the lamp can nevertheless be related to square-bodied lamps of Bailey type I. The color of its clay and slip, the depth of its basin, the globules impressed on the shoulder and base, and the plain *planta pedis* all attest to the eastern place of manufacture or origin of this lamp, purchased in Anatolia (see introduction [14. Loeschcke type VIII. a. General remarks](14.-Loeschcke-type-viii.-a.-General-remarks)). The ogival nozzle with shoulder-volutes differs from the nozzle of square-bodied lamps, another reason to present this shape individually. Lacking comparanda, it is difficult to propose a date, but taking into account the shape of the ring handle and of the nozzle with its shoulder-volutes, the last third of the first century A.D. is suggested.
