Cats. 7 and 8 have a circular, deep, flat-bottomed bowl with nearly vertical sides and a flat rim corresponding to the profile of lamp no. 12 in Gualandi Genito 1977, pl. 1. The outside of cat. 7 is glazed, but cat. 8 is self-slipped. Rather long nozzle with large wick-hole. Because the wick-holes of the two Getty lamps are not tangential to the rim as on Broneer’s earlier specimens, Gualandi Genito’s dating will be preferred: end of the fifth century B.C. and not earlier.
