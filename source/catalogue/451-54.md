The criteria used to distinguish groups b and c in the Aquileian material of Loeschcke type X are not always relevant to the Getty lamps, hence the recourse to a mixed group, Buchi X-b/c. These lamps are coarser than the lamps of previous groups and have rounded shapes of blurred relief. The lamps are executed in poor-quality clay, sometimes glazed or slipped, sometimes without any surface cover. The nozzle channel has no air hole. The base is usually circular with one or two rings. In cat. 454, which in contrast to the others has no shoulder lugs, the base tends toward a barely defined oval. None of these lamps bears a workshop signature. We will give them Buchiâ€™s dating: second century A.D.
