The main difference between lamps of this subtype and the other groups of type X is a circular basin with a short nozzle. The depth of the basin of the coarsely made cat. 457, its orange-brown color, and the shape of its plain *planta pedis,* suggest an eastern Mediterranean place of manufacture or origin, as is the case for cat. 455, also marked with a *planta pedis.* Both lamps were purchased in Asia Minor. The three theater masks on the discus of cat. 457 are hardly visible, and the three lugs on its shoulder are incised and not in sharp relief as on cat. 455. A date for cat. 457 at the end rather than the middle of the second century A.D., like cat. 455, seems probable.
