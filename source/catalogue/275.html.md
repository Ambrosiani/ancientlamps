Lamps of this type are scarce and characterized by their deep body, deeply sunken flat-bottomed discus, steeply sloping walls, and broad-based single nozzle. It appears four times only in BM II. Bailey states having found only one published parallel. Since then two lamp catalogues have recorded one example each: <a href='../../bibliography/#goethert-polaschek-1985'>Goethert-Polaschek 1985</a>, no. 695, pl. 74; and <a href='../../bibliography/#fitch-goldman-1994'>Fitch and Goldman 1994</a>, p. 184, no. 984, fig. 102. There are no examples in <a href='../../bibliography/#deneauve-1969'>Deneauve 1969</a> or <a href='../../bibliography/#bussiere-2000'>Bussi√®re 2000</a>. The date, according to Bailey, is the last years of the first century B.C. and the first third of the first century A.D.
