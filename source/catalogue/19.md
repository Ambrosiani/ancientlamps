About the third century B.C., Italian workshops developed a particular form, Pavolini’s biconical Esquiline type, corresponding to Borgia’s Tevere type, characterized by a carinated body, first without a handle but with a side-lug (Tevere 1); later without a side-lug but with a ring handle (Tevere 2). Both types have a nozzle in the shape of an anvil or an anchor. Apparently cat. 19 falls into Tevere 2 c, dated ca. 150–130 B.C. (Borgia 1998, fig. 15). Its body is not perfectly biconical, but Pavolini notes that the biconical shape of the type tends to get rounder with time (Pavolini 1990, p. 101). If the lamp is not Italian, it may have a Macedonian origin, as suggested by its resemblance to Drougou’s lamp no. 215 (Drougou 1992, no. 215, pl. 55, from {{loc_0000:Pella}}).
