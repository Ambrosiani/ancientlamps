As Bailey points out, his round-nozzled type B became standardized only in Tiberian times, when Loeschcke shoulder forms III and IV began to be introduced. Out of forty-two Getty lamps of type B group ii, there is one example of shoulder form II a, Claudian to Flavian; one of form II b, Tiberian to early Trajanic; thirty-two examples of form III (III a, III a var., or III b) falling mainly within the second and third quarters of the first century A.D.; seven cases of form IV a, Tiberian to Trajanic and even Hadrianic; and one form VI a, Tiberian to early Trajanic. A base-ring is seen on five lamps associated with shoulder form III. A slightly raised flat base marked off by one circular groove is found on thirty-five lamps. According to Bailey, this base is very common from the Claudian to the Early Trajanic period. Sixteen discus decors are related to mythology; nine to animals; six to amphitheater and circus; four to symplegma; five to daily life; the last two are a wreath and a rosette.

Seventeen lamps have a workshop mark on their base: a double *planta pedis* ({{insc:CCLO/CCLO}}), a second one plain; three marks (an impressed ovolo or a vertical stroke in relief); single letters in relief ({{insc:D, V, C}}); incuse initials ({{insc:L.M.C., L.M.S.A., M.S}}) or in relief ({{insc:M.S.V}}); single names: {{insc:GABINIA, SOTE}}; *tria nomina* ({{insc:COPPIRES, CCLOSVC, LMVNSVC}}\[?\]). It should be remembered that the *tria nomina* on lamps first appear in Late Flavian time.

The base of cat. 166 is decorated with three raised *pelta* motifs in relief, evenly distributed. Such *pelta*-shaped reliefs on the base occur on lamps with ear-lugs of Deneauve type V G: Perlzweig 1961, p. 79, no. 82, from the Athenian Agora; Menzel 1969, nos. 241–42, fig. 19, from {{loc_0000:Miletus}}; Miltner 1930, no. 82, pl. 11, from {{loc_0000:Ephesus}}. But they occur also on lamps of other types: Menzel 1969, no. 237, fig. 19, from Miletus, Loeschcke type IV; Heimerl 2001, pl. 1.9, Loeschcke type I with a strap handle, and Heimerl 2001, no. 291, pl. 7, Loeschcke type VIII, with an alpha mark on the base, both from {{loc_0000:Pergamon}}; and Bochum Museum, Schüller Collection, cat. no. 275 (Loeschcke VIII) from Anatolia. However, it would be wrong to deduce from these examples that the *pelta* design on a base is characteristic exclusively of the eastern Mediterranean. We find it in {{loc_0000:Cosa}}, Italy (Fitch and Goldman 1994, pp. 187–88, no. CEL 3, a lamp of Deneauve type V G); on an Italian lamp of the same type signed {{insc:OPPI RES}} (Hübinger 1993, no. 150, pl. 19); on a lamp of oval shape in the Museo delle Terme in Rome (Perlzweig 1961, ref. under her lamp no. 82); and on a sample of Loeschcke type VIII from Herculaneum (Bisi Ingrassia 1977, pl. 48.10b), although nothing proves that this last example had not been imported from an eastern province such as Egypt.

Bailey’s date for his group ii is Tiberian to Early Trajanic. On the basis of the period of activity of the workshops whose signatures appear on some Getty lamps, we have suggested other, mostly later, dates: Late Flavian instead of Tiberian (see [cats. 180](180), [189](189), [200](200), [203](203), [205–6](205-206)).
