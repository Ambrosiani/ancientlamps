Cat. 20 has a cylindrical body with side-lug, a depressed flat discus with a large central filling-hole, a stout round-ended nozzle with a large oval wick-hole, and a slightly raised flat base. It has near parallels in Deneauve type XIII, especially his lamps nos. 209 and 215, pl. 31, with a round-ended nozzle different from the anchor-shaped nozzle more common in the type (<a href='../../bibliography/#deneauve-1969'>Deneauve 1969</a>). Lamps of this shape have been found in shipwrecks dated to the second half of the second century B.C. (<a href='../../bibliography/#ricci-1973'>Ricci 1973</a>, p. 215). But Ricci points out that her type D derives from an earlier Greek globular body type—Howland 25 B—dated from the second half of fourth century B.C. into the first quarter of the third century B.C. Because of the tapering shape of its rounded nozzle, cat. 19 might be dated to the first half of second century B.C. The examples with an anchor-shaped nozzle would be better attributed to the second half of the same century.
