These lamps are characterized by a shoulder decor of vine-leaves and grapes. The Italic lamp <%= link_to "cat. 389", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> and the eastern examples cats. <%= link_to "390", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> and 429 have shoulder forms not recorded in Loeschcke’s classification and nozzle forms Bus. 10b. The nozzle underside of cats. <%= link_to "389", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> and <%= link_to "391", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> is decorated by a typical motif consisting of rays between curved lines. This decor, quite common on African lamps of the third century, should not be considered exclusively African, for <%= link_to "cat. 389", "catalogue/389-93.html" %>, which bears it, comes from an Italic workshop. The three other lamps are African and have Loeschcke shoulder form VII a and nozzle form Bus. 10c. Discus decors: mythology (4 ex.); daily life (1 ex.); and plain discus (1 ex.).

Four lamps have a base-ring. On cats. <%= link_to "389", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> and <%= link_to "391–92", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> this base is decorated with three ovo motifs evenly spaced between two circular grooves (for the motif, see <a href='../../bibliography/#bussiere-2000'>Bussière 2000</a>, p. 235, no. 76, fig. 54). This motif, which is often found on African lamp bases (e.g., cat. 365 form D X 1c), appears also on the Italic lamp cat. 389. One lamp has a base marked off by one circular groove; another a slightly raised base. <%= link_to "Cat. 389", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> is signed <span class="inscription">CPOMPO</span>, an Italic workshop active at the end of the second century A.D.; <%= link_to "cat. 393", "catalogue/389-93.html" %> is signed <span class="inscription">CHELIAN</span>, an African workshop of A.D. 175–225. Form D X 5 is dated from the end of the second century to the first third of the third century.
