The sixteen examples of this group all have a rounded shoulder, either Loeschcke form VI a (6 ex.), form VI b (7 ex.), form VII a (2 ex.), or form VII b (1 ex.). Only one, cat. 221, has a handle. Fourteen have a flat base marked off by a circular groove, two have a base-ring. The discus decors are related to mythology (7 ex.); theater and circus (3 ex.); animals (2 ex.); symplegma (1 ex.); one is a rosette, another a bust of Hadrian, and one has two gladiators. The workshop marks are: three plain single *planta pedis,* one double {{insc:PVF//PVF}}, and two illegible ones; one letter {{insc:T}} in relief; one name: {{insc:GABINIA}}, and three *tria nomina:* two {{insc:COPPIRES}} and one {{insc:CCLOSVC}}.

Bailey dates his group iii to the Late Tiberian to Early Trajanic period. We think Late Tiberian is a bit too early in several cases, for example, cat. 213, and therefore that the chronology may sometimes be extended. Such is certainly the case with cat. 211, decorated with Hadrianâ€˜s bust (see discussion in the introduction to type B), and for cat. 214 signed {{insc:GABINIA}}, cat. 215 signed {{insc:CCLOSVC}}, and cat. 220 signed {{insc:COPPIRES}}; for these we suggest a date from Late Flavian to Antonine.
