The main characteristic of D I 3 is the form of its nozzle, which is tangent to the lamp rim (nozzle form Bus. 3). Bailey type O group iii shows the same nozzle form and therefore corresponds to Bussière form D I 3, but the author points out that the five BM lamps all have a handle. Of nineteen Algerian examples in Bussière 2000, twelve do not have a handle, which is also the case with Getty cat. 278 ; the four other Algerian lamps in Bussière 2000 have a handle, as do cats. 279–82 and 329–37. The shoulder forms in this type vary a lot (Bussière 2000, p. 93). Among the Getty lamps we find Loeschcke shoulder forms VI a (2 ex.), VI b (3 ex.), VII a (1 ex.), VII b (5 ex.), VIII a (1 ex.), and four unrecorded variants. Three lamps have a plain discus; seven have a mythological motif; two a geometrical one; one an erotic scene; one a circus scene; one shows a dove on an olive branch; and one has a lion. There are five base-rings and eleven bases marked off by one circular groove. Bailey dates his type O group 3 from the middle of the first to the beginning of the second century A.D. A shipwreck at the {{loc_0000:Balearics}} dated to A.D. 40–50 (Domergue 1966, pl. 6) has yielded lamps, all signed by {{insc:CCLODV}}\[ivs\], some of them of Bussière form D I 3. The form is present in Campania: two samples found in Herculaneum bear the signature {{insc:PVF/PVF}} in *planta pedis,* an Italic workshop active between the middle and the last quarter of the first century A.D. Another example, found in Pompeii, is signed {{insc:LVC}} in *planta pedis,* an Italic workshop active between A.D. 50 and 80, according to Pavolini (Pavolini 1980, table I). But those early lamps have a basin with a quite thin wall, which is not the case with the Getty examples. Six Algerian lamps bear signatures of workshops starting their activity around A.D. 80: {{insc:OPPI}} (starting even around A.D. 70), {{insc:COPPIRES, L.MVNATVS, LMVNSVC}} (Bussière 2000, p. 94). Only one lamp, cat. 337, bears a workshop mark of a plain *planta pedis.* Judging by their coarseness, several lamps—cats. 279–82—are certainly of a later date: second century.
