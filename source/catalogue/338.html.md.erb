Bailey classifies in his type O group vi lamps of Loeschcke type VIII that “do not fall within the more rigid canons of [Bailey’s] types P and Q” (BM II, p. 310). The nozzle of cat. 338 has form Bus. 10c, a variant of the heart-shaped nozzle appearing in the second century A.D. (see, e.g., Deneauve 1969, nos. 904–6, pl. 82; Bailey BM II, Q 1249, pl. 63; or Bailey BM III, Q 3079 and Q 3081, pl. 103). However, an earlier nearly similar nozzle form, Loeschcke nozzle form K or Bus. 1, can be seen on first-century lamps (e.g., Bailey BM II, Q 1203–Q 1205, pl. 56; or Deneauve 1969, nos. 899–901, pl. 82). Therefore it would be wrong to attribute nozzle form Bus. 1 (instead of Bus. 10c) to cat. 338, which must be dated no earlier than the first half of the second century A.D.
