Cat. 18 has a bottle-shaped body with a funnel-shaped collar on a narrow neck and a long tubular nozzle splayed at the end. It is wheelmade in a light red clay (with a reddish-brown slip) and not in the typical gray Cnidian clay such as, for example, Bailey‘s Q 273 from {{loc_599575:Cnidus}}, or Bruneau’s no. 1957 from {{loc_599588:Delos}}, both decorated with the typical Cnidian molded slave masks and applied discs. Bailey reports many examples from {{loc_491678:Olynthos}} and in the Ptolemaic camp at {{loc_570125:Koroni}}. He dates the BM examples to the first half of the second century B.C. (Bailey BM I, p. 136). Both Bruneau (1965), with his example no. 1957 found at {{loc_599588:Delos}}, and Iconomu (1967), with a similar one found at {{loc_305064:Constantia}}, suggest a date from the second half of second century to the first quarter of the first century B.C.
